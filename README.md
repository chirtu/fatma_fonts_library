# ðŸ’– Fatma Fonts Library

Hi there! I'm Fatma, and I created this simple Flutter font package to help you style your apps beautifully and effortlessly ðŸ’…. The **Fatma Fonts Library** includes some of my favorite Google Fonts â€“ **Roboto** and **Poppins** â€“ and wraps them in a way that makes them super easy to use.

No more repeating the same `TextStyle` code or getting lost in font setups. Just plug, play, and keep your UI looking gorgeous! ðŸ’«
